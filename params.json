{"name":"Jquery.superlabels","body":"# jQuery Super Labels Plugin\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nThis plugin was born out of the need to use the label-over-field method for forms I was working on. There are other plugins out there that do pretty much the same thing, but none of them had the - for lack of a better word - sexiness that I was looking for. This implementation makes the label slide across the field☨ when gaining focus and fade out when a value is entered.\r\n\r\nThis method only really works for the following: input[type=\"text\"], input[type=\"search\"], input[type=\"url\"], input[type=\"tel\"], input[type=\"email\"], input[type=\"password\"], input[type=\"number\"], textarea, and finally there's select field support thrown in too.\r\n\r\n☨ Uses the easing plugin if available.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nHere's a (very) [simple demo](http://remy.bach.me.uk/superlabels_demo/) of Super Labels in action.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou need to make sure that the element containing both the field and the label has `position:relative;`. Other than that, the plugin should have enough flexibility to handle most of your needs.\r\n\r\n#### Basic\r\n\r\nThe quickest and easiest way to use this plugin is as follows:\r\n\r\n\t$('form').superLabels();\r\n\r\nRunning the plugin on a form will automatically apply the magic to the accepted fields listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you find that you need to position the labels slightly differently, pass in `labelLeft` and/or `labelTop` as follows:\r\n\r\n\t$('form').superLabels({\r\n\t\tlabelLeft:5,\r\n\t\tlabelTop:5\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n#### Advanced\r\n\r\nThere are quite a number of options you can pass the plugin additional to the two I mentioned above:\r\n\r\n* `baseZindex` - The base z-index which we display on top of. _(default: 0)_\r\n* `debug` - Whether or not to show console messages. _(default: false)_\r\n\t* Note: this is not available in the minified version.\r\n* `duration` - Time of the slide in milliseconds. _(default: 500)_\r\n* `easingIn` -  The easing in function to use for the slide. _(default: 'easeInOutCubic')_\r\n* `easingOut` -  The easing out function to use for the slide. _(default: 'easeInOutCubic')_\r\n* `fadeDuration` - Duration of animation when it's fade only. _(default: 250)_\r\n* `labelLeft` - The distance from the left for the label. _(default: 0)_\r\n\t* You can pass in 'px' if you're the pedantic type. For example: `labelLeft:'5px'`\r\n* `labelTop` - The distance from the top for the label. _(default: 0)_\r\n\t* As above: `labelTop:'5px'`\r\n* `noAnimate` - Whether or not to animate. If set to true, will function the same as a normal placeholder. _(default:false)_\r\n\t* This is a 'just in case' option that can/should be used when there are performance issues with animating.\r\n* `opacity` - The opacity to fade the label to. _(default: 0.5)_\r\n* `slide` - Whether or not to slide the label across the input field. _(default: true)_\r\n* `wrapSelector` - The selector for the element you have wrapping each field. _(default: false)_\r\n\t* This is used to find the label - use as a last resort. Rather make sure the field and label are next to each other in your markup, or failing that, that your labels use the `for` attribute that point to the field's `name` or `id`.\r\n\r\n#### Known Bugs\r\n\r\nBelow I'll list any bugs that I'm aware of and will try to get around to fixing as soon as I can.\r\n\r\n* Auto filling of form fields that is performed by some browsers causes a visual bug. Currently the label stays visible and positioned on top of the field while the field has a value.\r\n\r\n#### License\r\n\r\nMIT License - [http://remybach.mit-license.org/](http://remybach.mit-license.org/ 'Link through to read my License.')\r\n","tagline":"Give your forms a helping of awesome!","google":"UA-26812491-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
